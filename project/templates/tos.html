<h1 id="terms-of-service">Terms of Service</h1>
<p>June 15, 2021</p>
<h3 id="welcome-to-commonology-">Welcome to Commonology!</h3>
<p>Commonology builds technologies and services that enable people to connect with each other. </p>
<p>We don’t charge you to use Commonology. We may, in the future have revenue from advertisements or
    fees for premium services.</p>
<p>We don’t sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don’t share information that directly identifies you
    (such as your name, email address or other contact information) with advertisers unless you give us specific permission or enable us to list that information on game results, leaderboards, or conversations.</p>
<h2 id="the-services-we-provide">The Services we Provide</h2>
<p>We provide a trivia game as described in our  <a href="{% url 'tos' %}">Product Description</a>.
    The game is available to the public.</p>
<h3 id="combat-harmful-conduct">Combat Harmful Conduct</h3>
<p>People will only participate in Commonology if they feel safe. It is up to our community of players to
    alert us about misuse of our Products, harmful conduct towards others, and situations where we may be able
    to help support or protect our community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take
    appropriate action - for example, offering help, removing content, removing or restricting access to
    certain features, disabling an account, or contacting law enforcement. </p>
<h2 id="commonology-conversations">Commonology Conversations</h2>
<p>We welcome comments on our results pages, but not at the expense of the safety and well-being of others or
    the integrity of our community. You therefore agree to use your best judgement when adding comments keeping
    in mind that this a family oriented site.  Do not post anything that is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory
    or fraudulent. Do not infringe or violate someone else&#39;s rights, including their intellectual property
    rights.</p>
<p>We may remove or restrict access to content at the will of our game hosts and staff for any reason other than
    discrimination based on age, sex, religion, or race of the contributor.</p>
<p>To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe violates your
    rights (including intellectual property rights) or may be considered offensive to others.</p>
<h2 id="free-response-or-open-ended-responses">Free Response or Open Ended Responses</h2>
<p>A game host is someone who is responsible for running a game consisting of question selection and scoring.</p>
<p>Our game often has questions that invite an open ended response, any text a player wishes to enter.  We will
    use those responses to score the game.  Our methodology consists of things like categorizing responses so
    that more than one response my be treated as the same.  For example if one player enters &quot;pen&quot; and another
    player enters &quot;fountain pen&quot; we may consider those equal answers.  Categorization is a machine assisted human
    effort.  Our game host or scorer will use their discretion at times to do the best and fairest job according to
    their ability.</p>
<p>If a players enters inappropriate or offensive responses the host may at their discretion disqualify that question
    for the play and choose to ignore their responses or even disqualify the player from the game entirely.</p>
<h2 id="with-your-permission">With your Permission</h2>
<p>We assume permission from you to use any content you share with us to the extent that content is not protected by
    things like copyright or trademarks.  We need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a ‘license’) to use
    this content.  This includes using your content on other platforms to promote Commonology.</p>
<p>Specifically, when you share, post, or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in
    connection with our Products, you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, and
    worldwide license to host, use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly perform or display, translate, and
    create derivative works of your content. This means, for example, that if you share a comment on Commonology,
    you give us permission to store, copy, and share it with others. </p>
<p>You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and any information you provided.  Typically this
    information would be listed on game leaderboards and results pages.</p>
<p>Limits on using our intellectual property
If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products
    (for example, images, designs, videos, or sounds we provide that you add to content you create or share on
    Commonology), we retain all rights to that content. </p>
<h2 id="additional-provisions">Additional Provisions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Information Access
You may review any information on our site. You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means
    (without our prior permission) or attempt to access data you do not have permission to access.</li>
<li>Updating our Terms
We work constantly to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our community.
    As a result, we may need to update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices.
    Current Terms of Service will be available on our web site.</li>
<li>Account suspension or termination
We want Commonology to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts and ideas.
If we determine that you have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms of Service we may suspend or permanently
    disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other people’s
    intellectual property rights or where we are required to do so for legal reasons.
Where we take such action we’ll let you know and explain any options you have to request a review, unless doing so may
    expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere with the integrity or
    operation of any of our services, systems or Products; or where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or
    where we are prohibited from doing so for legal reasons.
You can learn more about what you can do if your account has been disabled and how to contact us if you think we have
    disabled your account by mistake.</li>
<li>Limits on liability
We work hard to provide the best Products we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Products,
    however, are provided &quot;as is,&quot; and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, or that
    they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL
    WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
    PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not
    responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive,
    inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content).
We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Products. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest
    extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues,
    information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of
    or related to these Terms or the Commonology Products, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
    Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Commonology Products will not exceed the
    greater of $100 or the amount you have paid us in the past twelve months whichever is less.</li>
<li>Disputes
We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise,
    however, it&#39;s useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.
For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms or the
    Commonology Products (&quot;claim&quot;), you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the
    Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the
    personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws
    of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</li>
<li>Other
These Terms make up the entire agreement between you, Commonology, and Quizitive, LLC. regarding your use of our Products.
    They supersede any prior agreements.
Some of the Products we offer are also governed by supplemental terms. If you use any of those Products, supplemental
    terms will be made available and will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you access or use our
    Products for commercial or business purposes, such as buying ads, selling products, developing apps, managing a
    group or Page for your business, or using our measurement services, you must agree to our Commercial Terms. If you
    post or share content containing music, you must comply with our Music Guidelines. To the extent any supplemental
    terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental terms shall govern to the extent of the conflict.
If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.
    If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these
    Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.
You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.
You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialized. Only your legacy
    contact or a person who you have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose
    your content upon death or incapacity will be able to seek disclosure from your account after it is memorialized.
These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are
    freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for example, if
    someone else claims the username and it appears unrelated to the name you use in everyday life).
We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. We may use them without any
    restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.</li>
