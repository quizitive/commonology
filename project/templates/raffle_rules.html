        Starting with Game 67, every game is another chance to win. Each week we’ll give a $50 Amazon gift card to a randomly selected player AND the player who referred them! That means the more players you refer, the more chances you have to win. Did playing Commonology just get even more fun? Why yes, yes it did.
