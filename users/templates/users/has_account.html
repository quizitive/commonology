<p>
    Thank you for suggesting your friend at {{ email }}.
    However, an account already exists for that address.
    It could be that your friend has not visited us and logged in for a very long time.
    Or, maybe our email messages are going to a spam or junk folder.
    Perhaps you can suggest that they try to login with us again.
